						<h1>"So, who is this guy?"</h1>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a guy who just hand-coded this 
						 page without the help of any measly "WYSIWYG" editors. This is a 
						 guy who had <strong>no prior experience</strong> with <strong>HTML</strong> or <strong>CSS</strong>
						 but diligently embraced this challenge, having only 10 days to 
						 learn the basics before presenting what you see before you today.</p>
						 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I live for; accelerated
						 learning and the pursuit of knowledge. Education, a cornerstone
						 in my life, has provided me endless opportunities to think outside
						 the box and to demonstrate my leadership as part of a team.</p>
						 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although being able to learn code 
						 from the couch is cool, the ability to work as part of a team 
						 solving real world problems in an efficient, logical, and immersive
						 environment is truly priceless. I am prepared to rigorously 
						 continue my self-education and strengthen my foundations so that
						 I may be of the most benefit to my cohort, when you select me 
						 for the <strong>May '14 Launch Academy</strong> program.</p>

						<h1>&nbsp;"A Man with a Plan!"</h1>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>This three phase plan can't be 
						 beat!</strong> To thrive in a team learning environment such as 
					     Launch Academy, you must come to the table equipped with a strong 
						 knowledge of the core materials. This helps everybody!</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Complete first coding challenge
							and deliver a hand-coded website to demonstrate ability to learn
							under pressure while still paying attention to detail.</li>
							<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Continue learning as much code as 
							possible by capitalizing on the tremendous amount of free
							resources available online. As well as learning more <em>HTML</em>
							and <em>CSS</em>, I plan to learn <em>jQuery</em> and finally
							finish my copy of "Learn <em>Python</em> the Hard Way."</li>
							<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> This is where Launch Academy
							comes in to merge my self-education with team-based, real
							world problem solving challenges! This is where all the magic 
							happens and the fun just begins!! After graduating from Launch
							Academy I will have all the skills necessary to make an 
							impact!!!</li>

							<h1>&nbsp;"If I'm not coding, where am I?"</h1>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having lived in New England most of
							my life, I have finally made the move to Boston just recently. 
							Over the past few years I was able to turn my love for music
							into a sustainable career by managing talented artists. Feel 
							free to check out <a href="http://www.yonasmusic.com">YONAS</a>, 
							a talented hip-hip artist that I have been working with. 
							Of course, music brings me to New York City routinely, so when I'm
							there, you can find me hanging out at my brother's doughnut shop,
							<a href="http://www.dunwelldoughnuts.com">Dun-Well Doughnuts</a>.
							</p>
							<p>And as if that doesn't keep me busy enough, when I find some 
							extra time here and there, I like to grab power tools, 
							some wood, and go build something. Personally, I find it 
							to be more relaxing than meditation. Check out this 
							<a href="./imgs/chair.jpeg">chair</a> that I built last summer from
							vintage water skis!</p>
							<p>And who doesn't love photography! Here's a <a href="./imgs/cityhallparknap.jpg">shot</a>
							or <a href="./imgs/rt2car.jpg">two</a> that I captured!</p>
